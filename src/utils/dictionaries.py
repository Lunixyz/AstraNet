#   These dictionaries were created for translation purposes.
#   The BOT was originally going to be used by non english-speaking people,
#   that is why they're still here, but they are almost useless, since they 
#   now are just uppercase versions of the original REST Engine values.
#
#   TO DO:
#   - Remove these useless dictionaries.
